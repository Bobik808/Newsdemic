**TO DO (logic team)**

- connect each variable mentioned in playthrough to types in object.ts, ie
     (blue) diseases store    ->    Diesease.cubesLeft
     inf. passive deck        ->    InfectionDeck.deckPassive

- write pseudo-code functions for all game actions

- move toward basic text version of the game (?)
