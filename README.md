## Viral
Welcome to Viral! A game where you stop the virus of misinformation...

# Introduction

Viral is based on the popular boardgame "Pandemic", more specifically the "Hot-zone North America" version, by zmangames. In Viral you must travel around town cleaning up the spread of misinformation coming from various sources. These sources come in three types; "social"- misinformation from social networks and other online platforms, "relations"- misinformation from friend and relatives, and "community"- misinformation from other institutions around the town.

This is a multiplayer game. Share the server and room name with a friend and they can join you too.

Each turn the player has four activities they can carry out. They can either move to an adjacent source, clean misinformation from their current source or fast travel to another source using one of their source cards. As the end of each turn two more source cards are delt and more misinformation spreads throughout the town depending on the spread level. The spread level increases each time one of those source cards turns out to be one of the 3 hidden Viral cards! The amount of misinformation which spreads each turn depends on the spread level. If a third marker of misinformation is put on a source there is an outbreak spreading it to adjacent sources. Each outbreak increases the chaos meter!

To win you must debunk all three types of misinformation. Each type of misinformation is debunked by collection 4 source cards representing that type of misinformation.

The game is over if the chaos meter increases to 100%, you run out of source cards or if you run out of any type of misinformation marker. 

Good luck!
